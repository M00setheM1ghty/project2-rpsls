                    <li>The game was popularized by the TV show "The Big Bang Theory"</li>
                    <li>There, genius theoretical Physicist Sheldon Cooper introduces this version of the game to show
                        off
                        his to his friends</li>
                    <li>Originally, Blogger Sam Kass came up with the variation of the game together with Karen Bryla,
                        with
                        the former claiming
                        that the show producer didn't ask permission to use it in The Big Bang Theory</li>
                    <li>The show rectified this behind-the-scenes resulting in Sheldon giving Kass the credit he
                        deserved
                        for it in season 5, episode 17 titled "The Rothman Disintegration."</li>
