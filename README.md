## Credits

The template for this readme and also the structure of the signup forms were taken(after asking) from my mentors project [LaLucha][def6].<br>
She also turned me onto using flexbox for styling the site. This site was used for learning the flexbox basics: [FlexBoxFroggy][def7].<br>

Thank you Lauren!

I have some knowledge from certifications I did outside of CodeInstitute so I relied less on sources from the internet. Hence the credit section is rather short. <br>
