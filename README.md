## UX

### Site Purpose

A fun little game to play against the computer to kill some time.

### Site Goal

Let the player play against the computer and track the score and the amount of games played.

### Audience

People under the age of 40. The show 'The big Bang Theory' popularised the game when mentioning it in one of their episodes.

### Communication

With a minimalistic design, the page content is easy to identify and makes the purpose of the site obvious.

### Current User Goals

Track the score and maybe implement a scoreboard to encourage coming back to play.

### New User Goals

+ to navigate the site with ease & clearly understand the purpose of the site.
+ have fun playing the game without the necessity to prepare much.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

These are the used colors in order: burlywood, brown, aliceblue, cornflowerblue and black. <br>

![Color Palette](./assets/images-readme/colorpallete-rps.webp)

Burlywood was used as the body's background color. The redish brown pops the content and buttons nicely off the background. <br>
The general text-content color is black.<br>
In contrast the buttons and navbar have aliceblue as font color to distinguish them.<br>
To make sure it is obvious that buttons/nav-elements are supposed to be clicked the text color changes to cornflowerblue on hover.<br>

### Typography

The fonts are set to default.

### Imagery

All the images found on the website are free stock images from [Pixabay][def3]. <br>
The image is supposed to highlight that the game is a version of rock paper scissors.

The template for this readme was taken(after asking) from my mentors project [LaLucha][def6].<br>
